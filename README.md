# Data Visualizations

The assignment was find a unique way to visualize cyclic data. I chose the weather patterns of Rochester, NY. Utilizing svg and d3.js library I was able to draw a square for each day of the year and the color is dependent on the temperature. The warmer the temperature the square will be colored a darker shade of blue - the colder the temperature the square will be colored a lighter shade of blue. Along with visually seeing the temperature differences through the different shades the user can also hover over any square to see the high and low temperature for a specific day.
