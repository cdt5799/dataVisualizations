# Data Visualizations

Weather: <br>
The assignment was find a unique way to visualize cyclic data. I chose the weather patterns of Rochester, NY. Utilizing svg and d3.js library I was able to draw a square for each day of the year and the color is dependent on the temperature. The warmer the temperature the square will be colored a darker shade of blue - the colder the temperature the square will be colored a lighter shade of blue. Along with visually seeing the temperature differences through the different shades the user can also hover over any square to see the high and low temperature for a specific day.

Social Media: <br>
The assignment was to find a unique way to visualize a complex data set. I chose to focus on social media usage by country. I researched data on how much of the total internet usage is social media per country and used a map to show the top 10 countries that use the internet for social media the most overall. I also broke it down by the most popular social media sites and the top 10 countries using with the most active register users. By hovering over the country the user can also see what place the country is ranked or how many users that country has on the certain social media site.

Fun and Games: <br>
The assignment was to choose a board or card game and come up with a series of data points and come up with a visualization that presents the data that you collected in a meaningful way. I created visualizations based on 4 different filters. The first is the minimum number of players required to play each game. The second is the maximum number of players allowed for each game. The third is based on the creators intended play time. The last filter relates to the age demographic the game is target for. While doing this research I learned that the most games are created for 2-4 players, intended to last no more than 30 minutes and are targeted for ages 6 and up. The user can see the demographics for each board game by hovering over the square.
